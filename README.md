Integrates ASP.NET Core Identity for secure and robust authentication and authorization.<br/>

**Logging**<br/>
Configured with Microsoft.Extensions.Logging to provide insightful and detailed logs for debugging and monitoring.<br/>

**REST Client**<br/>
A custom REST client service is implemented for handling HTTP requests and responses in a clean and reusable manner.<br/>

**Image Type Validation**<br/>
Includes functionality to check and validate the types of images being uploaded, enhancing security and data integrity.<br/>

**Local Storage Service**<br/>
Provides a service to interact with the browser's local storage, enabling persistent state on the client side.<br/>
